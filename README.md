A Chrome extension to create JSON Patch easily when we use JSON.  
Why JSON patch is very cool for developers ?

Because many developers use JSON APIs with a high-level of Richardson maturity model. The patch is often obtained by the difference of two JSON objects. However today I have no founded applications are able to do this operation, furthermore produce manually a patch can be tedious.  

This extension allows to create a JSON patch with the "diff" operation between two json objects. Soon, I would like to integrate the validation of a patch on an object.
