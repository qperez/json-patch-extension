# json-patch-extension

A website and a repository to create JSON Patch easily when we use JSON.  
Why the json-patcher is very cool for developers ?  

Because JSON is today everywhere and many developers use JSON APIs with a high-level of Richardson maturity model.

The patch is often obtained by the difference of two JSON objects. However today I have no founded applications are able to do this operation, furthermore produce manually a patch can be tedious. (me when I try to create my json PATCH without librairie)

The json-patcher allows to create a JSON patch with the "diff" operation between two json objects. json-patcher allows to validate a patch on a JSON object. 
Soon, I would like to integrate the validation of a patch on JSON-LD objects with "compact" and "expand" functions.

## Try 


hopefully soon...
